I am an Offering
I like to make things up.
I work at a college as a janitor even though I feel like I'm smarter than most of the people who go there. Sometimes I see an equation written on a blackboard like half an equation and... I just figure it out.
I work for myself
I'm Seeking Software Sales Position
I'm a freelancer.
